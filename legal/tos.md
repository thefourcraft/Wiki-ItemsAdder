# ⛔ TOS

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Before Buying Remember:**

* ⛔ **If you have another plugin that uses a custom resource pack you have to know how to merge it with the ItemsAdder resource pack or disable the other plugin.**
* ⛔ **Before asking for support, please read the tutorials**: [**official wiki**](https://itemsadder.devs.beer/)
* ⛔ You must **have** some **knowledge** on how to **create**/**manage**/**merge** vanilla Minecraft **resource packs** as this plugin uses a custom-made and modified resource pack to show custom textures/models. Please **if you have no knowledge about resource packs** don't buy the plugin.
* ⛔ I don't know if this plugin interferes with any other plugin, it's impossible to know that without testing every single plugin on the planet, so if the plugin doesn't work with your server setup don't ask for a refund but try to find the cause.
* ⛔ [**Not compatible with some plugins**](https://itemsadder.devs.beer/compatibility-with-other-plugins/not-compatible)
